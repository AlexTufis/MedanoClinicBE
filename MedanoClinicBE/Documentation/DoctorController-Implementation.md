# DoctorController Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the DoctorController with user role management functionality.

## Created Files

### 1. DTOs/UpdateUserRoleDto.cs
- **Purpose**: Data transfer object for updating user roles
- **Properties**: 
  - `UserId` (required): The ID of the user whose role needs to be updated
  - `RoleName` (required): The name of the role from the AspNetRoles table

### 2. Services/Interfaces/IDoctorService.cs
- **Purpose**: Interface defining doctor service operations
- **Methods**:
  - `UpdateUserRoleAsync(UpdateUserRoleDto dto)`: Updates a user's role
  - `GetAllDoctorsAsync()`: Retrieves all active doctors

### 3. Services/DoctorService.cs
- **Purpose**: Implementation of doctor service functionality
- **Key Features**:
  - Role validation before updating
  - Removal of all existing roles before assigning new role
  - Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
  - Error handling with detailed logging

### 4. Controllers/DoctorController.cs
- **Purpose**: REST API controller for doctor-related operations
- **Endpoints**:
  - `PUT /api/doctor/update-user-role`: Updates a user's role (Admin only)
  - `GET /api/doctor/doctors`: Retrieves all doctors (Doctor/Admin only)

## API Usage

### Update User Role Endpoint
```http
PUT /api/doctor/update-user-role
Authorization: Bearer <admin-jwt-token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "userId": "user-guid-here",
  "roleName": "Doctor"
}
```

**Response (Success)**:
```json
{
  "message": "User role updated successfully"
}
```

**Response (Error)**:
```json
{
  "message": "Failed to update user role. User or role may not exist."
}
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Authorization**: Only users with Admin role can update user roles
2. **Role Validation**: The system validates that the target role exists before assignment
3. **User Validation**: The system confirms the target user exists before role updates
4. **Logging**: All operations are logged for audit purposes

## Database Impact

This implementation works directly with ASP.NET Identity tables:
- **AspNetUsers**: The users table
- **AspNetRoles**: The roles table (Admin, Client, Doctor)
- **AspNetUserRoles**: The junction table that maps users to roles

## Dependencies Added

The DoctorService has been registered in `Program.cs` with the following dependencies:
- `UserManager<ApplicationUser>`: For user management
- `RoleManager<IdentityRole>`: For role management
- `IDoctorRepository`: For doctor data access
- `ILogger<DoctorService>`: For logging

## Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling:
- Invalid user IDs
- Non-existent roles
- Failed role assignments/removals
- General exceptions with detailed logging

All errors are logged with appropriate log levels (Warning for business logic errors, Error for technical failures).
