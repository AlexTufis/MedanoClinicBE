# UserRepository Update - GetAllUsersAsync Method

## Summary of Changes

### Modified: MedanoClinicBE\Repositories\UserRepository.cs

**Method Updated**: `GetAllUsersAsync()`

### Changes Made

**Before**: The method only included Admin and Client users
```csharp
// Only include Admin and Client users as per frontend interface
if (userRole == "Admin" || userRole == "Client")
```

**After**: The method now includes Admin, Client, and Doctor users
```csharp
// Include Admin, Client, and Doctor users
if (userRole == "Admin" || userRole == "Client" || userRole == "Doctor")
```

### Reason for Change

The AdminService was already counting Doctor users in the dashboard statistics using `GetUserCountByRoleAsync("Doctor")`, but the `GetAllUsersAsync` method was excluding them. This created an inconsistency where:

1. **Dashboard Statistics**: Showed counts for Admin, Client, AND Doctor users
2. **User List**: Only returned Admin and Client users (missing Doctor users)

### Impact

- **Admin Dashboard**: Now the user list will be consistent with the user count statistics
- **API Endpoints**: Any endpoint that uses `GetAllUsersAsync()` will now include Doctor users
- **Data Consistency**: The system now consistently handles all three user roles (Admin, Client, Doctor)

### Related Files

This change affects:
- `AdminController.GetAllUsers()` - Will now return Doctor users
- `AdminService.GetAllUsersAsync()` - Will now include Doctor users
- Admin dashboard user management interfaces

### Backward Compatibility

This change is backward compatible as it only adds more data (Doctor users) to the existing response. Frontend applications that were expecting only Admin and Client users will continue to work, but may now also receive Doctor users in the response.
